									<h2>Schedule</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
                                On April 11th 2020 I'm planning to watch some movies that I've been meaning to
                                get around to for a long time. Each of them feels significant in a way that makes
                                it hard to just put it on after dinner in the middle of the week. Like how you add
                                Roma to your list on Netflix, but you always end up watching some trash
                                like Tiger King. I'm putting the schedule here if you want to watch at the same 
                                time.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Adolescence of Utena (1999) 11am Toronto/12pm Halifax/4pm Edinburgh/6pm Turku</h3>
                                <p>
                                I thought this was just a recut of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrrh84y760v-hDEulas0Tp_wiQy0FcjLl">original Utena series</a> into a movie for years.
                                Turns out, it's a whole new piece of animation and it's <a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/36654/1/atena-the-trippy-anime-film-directed-by-ikuhard">totally wild</a>.
                                It's also somehow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KYmgUlXn6A&feature=youtu.be">still available on youtube for free</a>.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Velvet Goldmine (1998) 2pm Toronto/3pm Halifax/7pm Edinburgh/9pm Turku</h3>
                                <p>
                                This movie is from the 90s, it has Ewan McGregor and Eddie Izzard in it and it was directed by Todd Haynes.
                                About a year ago, some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases#Frequency_illusion">Baader-Meinhof</a> thing was happening where I kept hearing about it from different places.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990) 5pm Toronto/6pm Halifax/10pm Edinburgh/12am Turku</h3>
                                <p>
                                People on Twitter were checking which movie was number 1 in the box office when they were born.
                                This was number 1 in the US on April 11th 1990 and I haven't seen it yet.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Tokyo Story (1953) 8pm Toronto/9pm Halifax/1am Edinburgh/3am Turku</h3>
                                <p>
                                This film is number 1 on the Director's list for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sight_%26_Sound_Greatest_Films_of_All_Time_2012">Sight and Sound Greatest Movies of All Time</a> and number 3 on the Critic's poll. It's become a running joke that we
                                suggest watching whenever we're trying to pick a movie on Netflix,
                                "What should we watch?", "I dunno, maybe the greatest movie of all time?".
                                It has a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tokyo_story">100% score on Rotten Tomatoes</a>.
