								<p>
                                I've never felt that publishing papers was all that essential to research.
                                You might be looking around this website trying to find a list of 
                                published work. Don't worry, you didn't miss it, there isn't any.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Despite this, I've spent a lot of time thinking about things, and 
                                trying ideas that later turned out not to work very well. 
                                My supervisor is <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/">Amos Storkey</a>,
                                and we have worked on many ideas we later decided weren't worth publishing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                So far, we've worked on dropout, I replicated the 
                                <a href="https://github.com/gngdb/variational-dropout">variational dropout scheme of Kingma et al</a>.
                                We were working on adaptive dropout schemes for selection, and thanks to it's
                                Bayesian reasoning and efficient algorithm, I thought it pretty much closed
                                the book on learning which units or weights are important. Then 
                                <a href="It turns out://github.com/ars-ashuha/variational-dropout-sparsifies-dnn">sparsifying variational dropout came along</a>
                                so I replicated <a href="https://github.com/BayesWatch/tf-variational-dropout">that as well</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                After we worked on the value of nodes in an information processing graph,
                                but made no progress dealing with the factorial complexity of 
                                evaluating the Shapley Value. So, we gave up on that, and decided to
                                look at Bayesian modeling for context-specific importance measures at
                                test time, submitted to
                                <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wildml2016nips/schedule">reliable machine learning in the wild at NIPS 2016</a>
                                (the paper is not available).
                                </p>
                                <p>
								I've also worked on two Kaggle competitions in my spare time: the 
                                AES seizure prediction challenge and the first 
                                <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/datasciencebowl">National Data Science Bowl</a>.
                                In both, our team name was <a href="https://github.com/Neuroglycerin">Neuroglycerin</a>, 
                                and in both we achieved scores in the top 10%.

                                <p>
                                Also, I've worked on setting up an early-stage <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>
                                platform for students at the University of Edinburgh to use in 
                                the course Data, Design and Society. The server integrates JupyterHub
                                with the EASE authentication system and 
                                <a href="://github.com/edinburghlivinglab/livinglab-hubserver">runs in docker</a>.
                                </p>

                                <p>I am interested in how an information processing system can organize itself without global monitoring to perform a learning or inference task. Practically, I am lazy and would prefer it if the different processing stages would arrange themselves with as little input as possible. I'm researching methods to make this happen using transactional or adversarial systems, drawing on probabilistic and game theoretic reasoning.</p>
                                <p>In practice, I have worked on variational methods to investigate the importance of nodes in a feedforward neural network. In the process, I replicated the paper <a href="https://github.com/gngdb/variational-dropout">&quot;Variational Dropout and the Local Reparameterization Trick&quot;</a>. I am working on dealing with the combinatorial evaluation problem in deciding which units are useful to the network for structural decisions in networks.</p>

                                <p>This project is being supervised by Amos Storkey and D.K. Arvind on the subject of Transactional Filter Graphs. Details of this project can be found on my <a href="http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/dtc/index.php?option=com_projects&amp;func=showall&amp;projectid=580">profile page for the DTC for Neuroinformatics</a>.</p>

                                <p>Machine learning competitions are hosted regularly by the company Kaggle. I have entered two of these in teams with other Edinburgh students, both times achieving scores in the top 10%. These were <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/seizure-prediction/leaderboard">AES Seizure Prediction Challenge</a> and the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/datasciencebowl/leaderboard">National Data Science Bowl</a>. On the final leaderboards our team name was Neuroglycerin.</p>
                                <p>The code written for both competitions is available under an open source license on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Neuroglycerin/hail-seizure">hail-seizure</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Neuroglycerin/neukrill-net-work">neukrill-net</a>. Our seizure prediction was implemented with an array of signal processing techniques combined with a support vector machine classifier. We approached image classification with traditional convolutional neural networks despite trying many alternatives and modifications.</p>
